# PCA Warmup
hell yeah

## Concepts

#### Give at least two reasons why one might use PCA.  Be sure to include discussion of what problem PCA solves and how.

from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline
import pickle as pkl

with open('test_obj/X.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    X = pkl.load(f)

with open('test_obj/y.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    y = pkl.load(f)  

from test_scripts.test_class import Test
test = Test()
```




```python
import pandas as pd

df_x = pd.DataFrame(X)
df_y = pd.DataFrame(y)

df_y

## Application

### Data Exploration

- Turn `X` (a np array of features) into a dataframe.  How many features are there? 

- Turn `y` (a np array of the target) into a df.  What type of data is `y`?

- What kind of prediction problem is this?  


```python
# your work here
```

### PCA Exploration

#### Run the following steps
- TTS, `random_state` = 1

- Scale w/ StandardScaler

- For the full PCA transformation (ie, w/o specifying `n_components` number)
on `X_train`, store the explained variance ratio for each component 
in `evr`

- Graph `evr`

- Re-graph the first few components in order to focus on them (you'll see why)

How many principal components does it look like we should choose?


```python
#Your work here
```

### Calculate Train and Test Error

#### Run the following:
- for the first 50 principal components,
  - scale the data
  - generate the number of principal components and transform them into features
  - Using Logistic Regression with default inputs, generate train and test predictions through 10-fold cross validation
    - *Hint:* use `sklearn.cross_validate`
    - *Level up:* ideally, you would scale and PCA on each training fold (why?).  Use a pipeline!
  - graph the means of the train and test predictions for each number of principal component

#### Interpret the graph  
- How many principle components should we choose based on this?
- Is overfitting or underfitting a problem?

#### Level up
- Repeat the above but don't scale the data.  Intepret the results.


```python
#Your work here
```
